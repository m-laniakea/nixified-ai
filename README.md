#### Discussion

Anyone interested in discussing nixified.ai in realtime can join our matrix channel

- In a Matrix client you can type `/join #nixified.ai:matrix.org`
- Via the web you can join via https://matrix.to/#/#nixified.ai:matrix.org

#### The Goal

The goal of nixified.ai is to simplify and make available a large repository of
AI executable code that would otherwise be impractical to run yourself, due to
package management and complexity issues.

The outputs run primarily on Linux, but can also run on Windows via [NixOS-WSL](https://github.com/nix-community/NixOS-WSL). It is able to utilize the GPU of the Windows host automatically, as our wrapper script sets `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to make use of the host drivers.

The main outputs of the `flake.nix` at the moment are as follows:

#### KoboldAI ( A WebUI for GPT Writing )

- `nix run .#koboldai-amd`
- `nix run .#koboldai-nvidia`

#### InvokeAI ( A Stable Diffusion WebUI )

- `nix run .#invokeai-amd`
- `nix run .#invokeai-nvidia`

#### Rembg ( Automatic Background Remover )

- `nix run .#rembg-cpu -- i input.png output.png`
- `nix run .#rembg-cpu -- s --port 9226`

## Install NixOS-WSL in Windows

If you're interested in running nixified.ai in the Windows Subsystem for Linux, you'll need to enable the WSL and then install NixOS-WSL via it. We provide a script that will do everything for you.

1. Execute the following in Powershell

   `Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nixified-ai/flake/master/install.ps1'))`

The WSL must be installed via the Windows Store. The script will make an attempt to enable it automatically, but this only works on a fresh system, not one that has been modified manually.

See the following documentation from Microsoft for the details on how to enable and use the WSL manually
